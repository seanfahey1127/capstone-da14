\# 🦀⚓ Crunching Crab Capstone  

\*Capstone project for DA14\*



\## 🧾✏️ Overview



This project uses NOAA crab survey data to analyze trends in crab populations, species distribution, maturity, and disease over time. The analysis was conducted using Power BI and Power Query as part of a data analytics capstone project.
